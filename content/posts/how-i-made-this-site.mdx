# But why?

I've made a site similar to this in the past where I would just record my development notes but I always wanted to specifically make a blog at one point. I'd say I'm pretty intermediate in my skills with coding but when I was first starting or trying to advance my skills, I always asked myself how people made things. There are so many tutorials on how to make to-do lists and make clones of existing apps but I always wanted to see what developers were actually planning, thinking and doing when they made their programs. 

I've come across a few blogs like this and now I want to have my own blog, to help me journal my own progress and maybe some people will see it too. 

# Next.js

The previous site I mentioned earlier that I had made was made with simple React, but it had it's own database running, specifically using Mongo Atlas. Looking back, yeah that was overkill. But it was a great learning experience and I loved the way it looked.

It's no longer hosted (I had my AWS account compromised and I just never bothered to host it back up ðŸ˜¬) but you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/daee-kang/TIL). 

I kept hearing about **JAMstack** and **next.js** and there's like a million JavaScript technologies out there so I never really paid attention to it. I was working and I just stumbled on a medium article about JAMstack and halfway in I kinda just had to say *okay yeah this kinda sick.*
